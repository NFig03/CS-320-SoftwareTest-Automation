-There are various tactics to utilize when one desires to ensure their programs are functional and secure. First and foremost, it is important to adhere to proper coding guidelines and naming conventions. This will ensure clean and readable code which is far easier to debug. It is also important to ensure that secure coding guidelines are being adhered to constantly throughout development to mitigate as many potential vulnerabilities as possible. After initial development has been completed, it is important to implement a rigorous testing phase. Thorough testing of the system will ensure properly functioning code. This testing should include both static and dynamic testing. Static and dynamic security testing of the software must be performed as well. To ensure properly functioning code, strategies such as code reviews and unit testing must be implemented. Code review must also be utilized to ensure secure code in correlation with dependency checking tools to ensure that third-party software does not introduce new vulnerabilities to the system. Throughout the entire lifespan of the system, there should be monitoring and logging of data to assist with the release of effective updates and patches to maintain functionality and security of the program.
